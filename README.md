stock_data
A Script was created to loop through all the stocks for one year that output the following:
   - The ticker symbol

   - Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price    at the end of that year

   - The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the           closing price at the end of that year
    
   - The total stock volume of the stock
    
   - the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
